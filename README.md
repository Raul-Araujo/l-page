Application of all knowledge gained on TOP's HTML and CSS modules.
Firstly, I divided everything into four parts (besides header and footer).
Doing that, through HTML's file in which I tried to organize, as much as possible, all parts of the given design.
After conecting HTML file to CSS file, I used comments to organize the CSS file.
    # Organizing mainly through flexbox tool.
    # I tried to get stick to the given design only adding some images to bring more context to the page.
